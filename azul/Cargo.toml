[features]
# The "SVG" feature only enables the creation of shapes / polygons, etc. not the actual parsing
# (which needs the `svg_parsing` feature).
default = [
    "logging",
    "native-style",
    "css-parser",
]
# Enable this feature to enable crash logging & reporting.
# Azul will insert custom panic handlers to pop up a message and log
# crashes to an "error.log" file, see AppConfig for more details
logging = ["azul-dependencies/logging"]
# The SVG rendering module is pretty huge since it needs lyon - if you don't use
# SVG rendering in your app, you can turn this off to increase compilation
# speed and decrease your binary size
svg = ["azul-dependencies/svg"]
# This is for activating **parsing** of SVG files. If you, for example, just
# want to draw shapes on the screen, you do not need to activate this feature,
# this is just for parsing the SVG from a file.
svg_parsing = ["azul-dependencies/svg_parsing", "svg"]
# If you want an application icon, you can either load it via the raw
# RGBA bytes or use the icon_loading feature to decode it from a PNG / JPG /
# whatever image format on startup. Note that this will import the image
# dependency and use a bit of extra runtime.
icon_loading = ["azul-dependencies/icon_loading"]
# For serializing / deserializing CSS colors using serde
serde_serialization = ["azul-dependencies/serde_serialization"]
serde_serialization_css = ["css-parser", "azul-css-parser/serde_serialization"]
# twox-hash imports the rand crate, which takes a long time to compile
# If azul isn't using XXHash, it uses the std-library provided hash algorithm
#
# The performance hit should be negligible, so this feature is turned off by
# default. Maybe turn it on in release builds.
faster-hashing = ["azul-dependencies/faster-hashing"]
# On some applications you might not want to load any images. For these purposes
# the image crate can be disabled, to speed up compile times
